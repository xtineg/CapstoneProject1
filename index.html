<h2> Summary</h2>
<p>I am a highly motivated individual who values working with a team.
     Because of my previous experience in sales as both front end and back end,
      I pay attention to details. I am able to multitask if absolutely needed, 
      but I am able to work in a fast-paced environment and is able to learn quickly.
       When there is a challenge I do my best to find a solution and
        I always try to think outside the box for creative solutions.
     In the event I am unable to find an answer I will not shy away from asking help 
     from my peers.</p>
