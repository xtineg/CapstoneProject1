    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> Hi my name is Christine ,I'm 28 years old living in the Philippines.
         Currently in a Web Dev Bootcamp.
          I am currently learning how to make websites at HTML 
         and about to enter CSS .
          I am a huge gamer as well. 
          I grew up gaming and I am super passionate with this hobby.
          I love how gaming brings people closer to us from around the globe.
          I have met new people thanks to this and has greatly saved me mentally.
          I also build PCs when I have the oppurtunity. I am greatly into Keyboards as well. 
        I have also rescued and foster so many cats in my lifetime.

    </p>
